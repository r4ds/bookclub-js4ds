# Introduction

**Learning objectives:**

- Download **Node.js** and **npm**.
- Get familiar with **Visual Studio Code** and **Quokka.js**.

## The Shape of Things to Come {-}

- In this book, we'll cover the following topics:
    - Core features of modern JavaScript.
    - Programming with **callbacks** and **promises**.
    - Creating objects and **classes**.
    - Writing **HTML** and **CSS**.
    - Creating interactive pages with **React**.
    - Building data services.
    - Testing.
    - **Data Visualization**.
    - Combining everything to create a 
    [three-tier](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24649/three-tier-architecture)
    web application.

- We'll cover an even mix of **browser** programming
and **server** programming.

## Who You Are {-}

- The prototypical users of this book:
    - Can write programs that use lists, loops, conditionals and functions.
    - Can run basic commands in a **command-line interface** (CLI), such as
    change, create or delete a directory.
    - Have reliable access to the internet.

## Who We Are {-}

    - Made these book clubs [happen](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/starting-an-r-book-club-cooking-up-friendships-in-isolation/) in early 2020.
    - Co-creator of the [Mastering Shiny Solutions](https://mastering-shiny-solutions.org/) book.

- [Toby Hodges](https://tbyhdgs.info/)
    - Also co-wrote a book called [Introduction to Regular Expressions](https://tobyhodges.gitbooks.io/introduction-to-regular-expressions/content/).

- [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/)
    - One of the main contributors of [TidyBlocks](https://third-bit.com/2021/07/22/whatever-happened-to-tidyblocks/),
    a block based tool for data analysis and visualization, originally created by 
    [Maya Gans](https://twitter.com/mayacelium/status/1154794578102247425).

## Setting Up {-}

- [Repository](https://github.com/software-tools-books/js4ds/tree/master/src) 
with the code examples of the book, organized by chapters.

- The **exercises** are **not optional** ... they include new information
necessary later in the book.

- [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) the 
the latest Long-term Support (LTS) versions of **Node** and **npm**.

- **Node** will allows us to execute JavaScript code:
    - Via a **REPL**: `node` 
    - Execute a JavaScript file: `node fileName.js`

- **npm** is the **Node Package manager**, a 
command line tool for *finding*, *installing*,
*updating*, *building* and *executing* JavaScript libraries.

- These are some common **npm** commands:
    - [**Locally**](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5108) 
    install a library (just for the current project folder):
    `npm install libraryName`
    - **Globally** install a library, so that all projects can use it:
    `npm install -g libraryName`
    - Show locally installed libraries:
    `npm list`
    - Show gloablly installed libraries:
    `npm list -g`
    
## Setting Up (Extra) {-}

- In this book, we'll be working with
files with extension `.html`, `.css` and `.js`.

- The **RStudio** IDE has support for such types
of files ... it's good, but not great.

- Therefore, an IDE more suitable for **web development**
may be used, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

- In particular, the **VS Code** extension called
[Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode)
is very useful for the types of exercises that we'll cover in this book.

## Contributing {-}

- Contributions of all kinds are welcome:
    - Errata
    - Minor improvements
    - New sections or chapters

- To contrinute, submit a pull request to this
GitHub [repository](https://github.com/software-tools-books/js4ds/).

## Exercises {-}

```bash
node --version
