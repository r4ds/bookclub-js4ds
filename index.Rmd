# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the JavaScript for Data Science book club! 

This website is a companion for the book [_JavaScript for Data Science_](https://third-bit.com/js4ds/) by Maya Gans, Toby Hodges, and Greg Wilson (copyright January 2020).
This companion is available at [r4ds.io/js4ds](https://r4ds.io/js4ds).

This website is being developed by the [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://rfordatasci.com). Follow along, and [join the community](https://r4ds.io/join) to participate.

This companion follows the [R4DS Online Learning Community Code of Conduct](https://r4ds.io/conduct).

## Book club meetings {-}

- Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter).
  - **This is the best way to learn the material!**
- Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter.
- More information about how to present is available in the [github repo](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-js4ds).
- Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the [R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel](https://r4ds.io/youtube).

## Pace {-}

- We'll _try_ to cover 1 chapter/week, but...
- ...It's ok to split chapters when they feel like too much.
- We will try to meet every week, but will likely take some breaks for holidays, etc.

## How to present {-}

- The meeting's presentator doesn't need to use the
R **bookdown** package for the chapter slides.

- However, it's **highly beneficial** (for all present and future cohort members)
that the chapter notes are created via `bookdown`.

- If you are comfortable with **R**, you may follow
these [instructions](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-js4ds#how-to-present).

- If you are comfortable with **Git** and **GitHub**, you may
follow these alternative steps:
    1. **Fork** this bookclub's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-js4ds).
    1. From your forked repo, **create a branch** for your notes of the chapter to present.
    1. After saving your finished chapter notes, **add**, **commit** and **push**
    your changes into your forked repo.
    1. Finally, create a **pull request** in order to update the online version of the book.
